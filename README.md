- 👋 Hi, I’m @mehulphy
- 👀 I’m interested in data science using python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and I have some level of exposure with HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Fortran programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects mainly focussed on studying data and drawing insighful inferences from it.
- 📫 You can reach out to me at quantumehul@gmail.com
